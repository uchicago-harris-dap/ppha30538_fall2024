### MUD cards: about you!
- Really fun to get to know a little more about you through MUD cards
- Diversity of professional backgrounds! Some examples of note: geopolitical risk management, AmeriCorps, film industry background, actor, criminal justice, want to do PhDs
- Diversity of interests! Some examples of note: playing tuba, owner of 2 pet bunnies, "legendarily bad at darts," knows 5 languages, running a marathon later this month, a short story (mystery and fantasy) author, favorite foods include green curry and boba tea

### MUD cards: general questions
- How to study for lab quizzes: based directly on lecture
    - Pay attention to lecture and engage with in-class exercises
    - Know how to read and interpret Python functions relevant to lecture
    - You won't be asked to memorize syntax, but rather look at a chunk of code and explain what it does or find a bug in it
- Final project parameters: will be released some time this week
- Recording lectures: XXX (policy TBD)

### PS1 Recap
- **Realistic over perfect and clean**: some hiccups with submission - thank you for your patience as we converge on submission processes
- **Self-sufficiency**

    - Help us help you: on Ed or at office hours, describe *in as much detail as possible* what your issue is, what you've tried, and why it seemed to not work, rather than just "I don't know how to do this."
    - Use your peers: if you notice in lab or from Ed that other students seemed to have gotten past the step at which you are stuck, ask them for help!
    
### EdDiscussion Shoutouts
- Lively discussions on Ed on problem set, troubleshooting, etc. - this is great
- Reminder: up to 2% extra credit for answering questions or posting useful info
