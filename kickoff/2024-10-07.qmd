### Pulling this week's material -- `main` branch

![Sync fork](pictures/sync_main.png)

### Pulling this week's material -- `after_lecture` branch

![Switch branches](pictures/switch_branches.png)

Then hit "sync fork again"

Finally, pull the changes from the remote repo to your local repo ("pull" is git jargon which we will cover in detail in a few more weeks. in github desktop this is called "sync"ing)

### MUD cards: about you professional (Professor Ganong)

- I loved reading these cards this weekend.

- Professional
    - Three current or former teachers in the class 
    - Sustainable public transport system
    - Chinese port acquisitions
    - "PC game boy"
    - A huge number of you have internships or research projects where you are already using DAP skills -- awesome! Excited to hear more about these

- "Observed the same things when I worked at the Mayor's Office this summer in Chicago"

### MUD cards: about you personal (Professor Ganong)

- Violinist in the University Symphony Orchestra

. . .

- Has two kids

. . .

- Mechanical pencil collection

. . .

- Semi-professional Chinese dancer

. . .

- Singers: jazz, hip-hop

. . .

- Once got a concussion from getting hit in the head by a fish

. . .

- One of you claims to have lived here for a winter and still says that they love the weather in Chicago


### MUD cards: about you! (Professor Shi)
- Really fun to get to know a little more about you through MUD cards
- Diversity of professional backgrounds! Some examples of note: geopolitical risk management, AmeriCorps, film industry background, actor, criminal justice, want to do PhDs
- Diversity of interests! Some examples of note: playing tuba, owner of 2 pet bunnies, "legendarily bad at darts," knows 5 languages, running a marathon later this month, a short story (mystery and fantasy) author, favorite foods include green curry and boba tea

### Week 1 Recap
- Thank you all for your feedback on Ed - we are glad that you feel comfortable voicing concerns about the class!
\vspace{2ex}
    - **Realistic over perfect and clean**: thank you for your patience as we converge on submission processes
    - If dataset is very large: develop your code on a subset first using `df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv', nrows = 1000)`
- **This class is hard.** 
\vspace{2ex}
    - Learning to be an analyst is hard! And as an analyst, you will be asked to do things you were never taught.
    - Much of what is on problem sets is not covered in lecture -- this is by design.
    - We will try to provide resources to support you. But you should expect to dedicate 10-20 hours a week -- likely on the higher end in the first few weeks
    

### Week 1 Recap
- We introduced three new concepts in the first week: VSCode + Quarto + Altair
\vspace{2ex}
    - The steepest part of the learning curve is likely last week
    - We will use VSCode and Quarto through the rest of the quarter
    - And stay with Altair through the end of week 3
- Getting help:
\vspace{2ex}
    - Help us help you: on Ed or at office hours, describe *in as much detail as possible* what your issue is, what you've tried, and why it seemed to not work. We will discuss in lab how how to create reproducible examples
    - Leverage your peers: if you notice in lab or from Ed that other students seemed to have gotten past the step at which you are stuck, ask them for help!

### Debugging Tips
- *Highly* recommend copy and pasting your errors into ChatGPT and asking it what is wrong. This should be the first step of your troubleshooting "flowchart."
\vspace{2ex}
    - Many of our answers to your Ed questions are us just doing this.
- Insert `print()` statements throughout Python code 
- Places to look for Quarto rendering errors
\vspace{2ex}
    - Terminal output
    - In log file: use `quarto preview my-file.qmd --debug` to create `my-file.log`
- Isolate the error: if a Quarto document fails to compile, comment out sections of the document until you isolate which part is causing the issue
    - Sometimes commenting out doesn't work -- try removing it outright
    
    
### EdDiscussion Shoutouts
- Lively discussions on Ed on problem set, troubleshooting, etc. - this is great!
- Reminder: up to 2% extra credit for answering questions or posting useful info

### Other Admin Announcements
\vspace{2ex}
- Lab quizzes are based directly on lecture
    - Pay attention to lecture and engage with in-class exercises
    - Know how to read and interpret Python functions relevant to lecture
    - You won't be asked to memorize syntax, but rather look at a chunk of code and explain what it does or find a bug in it
- Final project parameters will be released some time this week
- Problem set 1 solutions are live
- Problem set 2 is live and due at end of *next* week (Sat Oct 19)
    - It is on visualization and altair
    - Give yourself time to do it -- longer than PS1
